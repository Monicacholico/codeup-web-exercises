        <dt>1. How old is the National Park System?</dt>
        <dd class="invisible">The National Park Service was created by an
            act signed by President Woodrow Wilson on August
            25, 1916. Yellowstone National Park was established
            by an act signed by President Ulysses S. Grant on
            March 1, 1872, as the nation's first national park.

        <dt>2. What is the origin of the National Park Service arrowhead?</dt>
        <dd class="invisible">The arrowhead was authorized as the official National
            Park Service emblem by the Secretary of the Interior on
            July 20, 1951. The components of the arrowhead may have
            been inspired by key attributes of the National Park
            System, with the sequoia tree and bison representing
            vegetation and wildlife, the mountains and water
            representing scenic and recreational values, and the
            arrowhead itself representing historical and archeological
            values. </dd>
