        <dt>1. How old is the National Park System?</dt>
        <dd class="invisible">The National Park Service was created by an
            act signed by President Woodrow Wilson on August
            25, 1916. Yellowstone National Park was established
            by an act signed by President Ulysses S. Grant on
            March 1, 1872, as the nation's first national park.
            View the National Park System timeline.</dd>
        <dt>2. What is the origin of the National Park Service arrowhead?</dt>
        <dd class="invisible">The arrowhead was authorized as the official National
            Park Service emblem by the Secretary of the Interior on
            July 20, 1951. The components of the arrowhead may have
            been inspired by key attributes of the National Park
            System, with the sequoia tree and bison representing
            vegetation and wildlife, the mountains and water
            representing scenic and recreational values, and the
            arrowhead itself representing historical and archeological
            values. </dd>
        <dt>3. How many areas are in the National Park System?</dt>
        <dd class="invisible">The system includes 417 areas covering more than 84 million
            acres in every state, the District of Columbia, American
            Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands.
            These areas include national parks, monuments, battlefields,
            military parks, historical parks, historic sites, lakeshores,
            seashores, recreation areas, scenic rivers and trails,
            and the White House. Learn more about national park designations.</dd>
        <dt>4. What is the largest national park site? </dt>
        <dd class="invisible">Largest: Wrangell-St. Elias National Park and Preserve, AK, at 13.2 million acres</dd>
        <dt>5. What is the smallest national park site? </dt>

        <dt>8. Where can I find a park map?</dt>
        <dd class="invisible">You can view maps on specific park websites or download maps from the
            Harpers Ferry Center map collection.</dd>
        <dt>9. Can I bring my pet to a national park?</dt>
        <dd class="invisible">Some national parks welcome pets—in developed areas, on many trails
            and campgrounds, and in some lodging facilities. Learn more about pets in parks.</dd>
        <dt>10. What do I need to know about driving off road in national parks?</dt>
        <dd class="invisible">Before you head out, check with the national parks that you intend to visit.
            In many national parks, off-road driving is illegal. Where off-road driving
            is allowed, the National Park Service regulates it.</dd>
